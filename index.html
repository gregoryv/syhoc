               Format rules for plain-text specifications

                            by Gregory Vincic



Abstract

   Specifications need to be concise and correct.  Preformated
   plain-text documents are easy to read and many follow <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> for
   when phrasing requirements.  This document defines rules for
   authoring plain-text specifications and tagging requirements for easy
   reference.

<a id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a> Introduction

   Plain-text documents, i.e. RFC series, have a proven track record as
   workable specifications.  These documents have been enhanced and
   clarified over time by subsequent sepcifications like the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>.
   Specifications that govern software are often written in this format.
   There is however no easy way to reference requirements directly when
   validating software.  A test suite could e.g. use the wording of a
   requirement verbatim if it fails, but duplicating the text within a
   test is not feasible as requirements change over time.  Having a way
   to easily index all requirements and reference them elsewhere keeps
   the requirements at it's source.  Differentiating changes in plain
   text is well defined, making it a powerful way of conveing changes
   over time.

<a id="section-1.1" href="#section-1.1">1.1</a> Purpose

   Specify minimal format rules to plain-text documents which enables
   developers to use processing tools, like <a href="https://github.com/gregoryv/stp">stp</a>, when producing the
   final document.  The final document in this context is a preformatted
   HTML file.

<a id="section-1.2" href="#section-1.2">1.2</a> Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>].




<a id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a> Format Rules

   Main purpose of formatting rules is to enable writers and readers to
   focus on content as much as possible and secondary enable tooling to
   process them for improved presentation or automated consumption.
   The <a href="https://gregoryv.github.io/syhoc/spec.txt">source of this document</a> is written following these rules.


<a id="section-2.1" href="#section-2.1">2.1</a> Sections

   Sections SHOULD<sub><a id="R1" href="#R1">1</a></sub> start with the § sign followed by a level and a
   heading.

       "§9.1 Example Heading..."


<a id="section-2.2" href="#section-2.2">2.2</a> Requirement Identifiers

   Without requirement identifiers it's hard to reference them at the
   source.  Requirement identifiers SHOULD<sub><a id="R7" href="#R7">7</a></sub> be written within
   parenthesis and start with '#R' followed by a number.

       "... (#R7) ..."

   Requirement identifiers MUST<sub><a id="R10" href="#R10">10</a></sub> be unique within one
   specification.

   Once a requirement identifier has been assigned and specification
   published, it MUST NOT<sub><a id="R11" href="#R11">11</a></sub> be reused.


<a id="section-2.3" href="#section-2.3">2.3</a> Links

   Reuirement links MUST<sub><a id="R8" href="#R8">8</a></sub> be placed directly after one of the
   keywords as defined by <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>.


<a id="section-2.3.1" href="#section-2.3.1">2.3.1</a> Links to Sections

   Links to sections MUST<sub><a id="R2" href="#R2">2</a></sub> be written within parentheses.

       "... (§9.1) ..."

   Transformed links to sections SHOULD<sub><a id="R3" href="#R3">3</a></sub> replace the § sign with the
   word 'section'.

       "... (section 9.1) ..."


<a id="section-2.3.2" href="#section-2.3.2">2.3.2</a> External Links

   Within a body of test external links and their URL make them less
   readable.  By separating the phrase that should be linked and the URL
   readability is improved.

   External link phrase SHOULD<sub><a id="R4" href="#R4">4</a></sub> be written within square brackets.

       "... [some phrase] ..."

   URL's of external link phrases SHOULD<sub><a id="R5" href="#R5">5</a></sub> be defined on separate
   lines.  Preferably at the end of a document or section.

       "[some phrase]: https://example.com"

   Lines defining URL's for external link phrases MAY<sub><a id="R9" href="#R9">9</a></sub> be removed
   from the final document.


<a id="section-2.3.3" href="#section-2.3.3">2.3.3</a> Internal Reference Links

   Internal reference links SHOULD<sub><a id="R6" href="#R6">6</a></sub> be written within square
   brackets.

       "... see [1] ..."

   These links refer to a list of references in the same document.  In
   this document see (<a href="#section-3">section 3</a>).
