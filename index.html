Abstract

   Specifications need to be concise and correct.  Preformated RFC like
   documents are easy to read and many follow <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> for phrasing
   requirements.  This document specifies rules for writing plain text
   specifications with tagged requirements for further processing.

<a id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a> Introduction

   Plain text documents, i.e. RFC series, have a proven track record as
   workable specifications.  These documents have been enhanced and
   clarified over time by subsequent sepcifications like the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>.
   Specifications that govern software are often written in this format.
   There is however no easy way to refer to requirements directly when
   validating software.  A test suite could e.g. use the wording of a
   requirement verbatim if it fails, but duplicating the text within a
   test is not feasible as requirements change over time.  Having a way
   to easily index all requirements and reference them elsewhere keeps
   the requirements at it's source.  Differentiating changes in plain
   text is well defined, making it a powerful way of conveing changes
   over time.

<a id="section-1.1" href="#section-1.1">1.1</a> Purpose

   Specify minimal format rules to plain text documents which enables
   developers to use processing tools, like <a href="https://github.com/gregoryv/mkdoc">mkdoc</a>, when producing the
   final document.  The final document in this context is a preformatted
   HTML file.

<a id="section-1.2" href="#section-1.2">1.2</a> Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>].




<a id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a> Format Rules

   Main purpose of formatting rules is to enable writers and readers to
   focus on content as much as possible and secondary enable tooling to
   process them for improved presentation or automated consumption.


<a id="section-2.1" href="#section-2.1">2.1</a> Sections

   Sections SHOULD<sub><a id="R1" href="#R1">1</a></sub> start with the § sign followed by a level and a
   heading.

       §9.1.5 Example Heading

<a id="section-2.2" href="#section-2.2">2.2</a> Links


<a id="section-2.2.1" href="#section-2.2.1">2.2.1</a> Requirement Links

   Requirement links SHOULD<sub><a id="R7" href="#R7">7</a></sub> be written within parenthesis and start with
   '#R' followed by a number.

       &lpar;#R7&rpar;

   Reuirement links MUST<sub><a id="R8" href="#R8">8</a></sub> be placed directly after one of the
   keywords as defined by <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>.


<a id="section-2.2.2" href="#section-2.2.2">2.2.2</a> Links to Sections

   Section links MUST<sub><a id="R2" href="#R2">2</a></sub> be written within parentheses.

       "... (&sect;2.1)."

   Link sections SHOULD<sub><a id="R3" href="#R3">3</a></sub> replace the § sign with the word 'section'.

       "... (<a href="#section-2.1">section 2.1</a>)."


<a id="section-2.2.3" href="#section-2.2.3">2.2.3</a> External Links

   External links SHOULD<sub><a id="R4" href="#R4">4</a></sub> be written within square brackets.

       "&lbrack;RFC 2119&rbrack;"

   URL's of external links SHOULD<sub><a id="R5" href="#R5">5</a></sub> be defined on separate lines.
   Preferably at the end of a document or section.

       "&lbrack;RFC 2119&rbrack;: https://example.com"

   URL defined lines SHOULD<sub><a id="R9" href="#R9">9</a></sub> be removed from the final document.


<a id="section-2.2.4" href="#section-2.2.4">2.2.4</a> Internal Reference Links

   Internal reference links SHOULD<sub><a id="R6" href="#R6">6</a></sub> be written within square
   brackets.

       "... see [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]."

   These links refer to a list of references, most likely found in a
   separate section.  In this document see (<a href="#section-3">section 3</a>).
