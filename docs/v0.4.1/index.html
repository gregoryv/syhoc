         Identify requirements within plain-text specifications

Status of This Memo

   This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is
   published for examination, experimental implementation, and
   evaluation.

Abstract

   Plain-text specifications are readable and many follow <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>
   when phrasing requirements.  This specification introduces a syntax
   to augment such requirements with identifiers for easy reference.

<a id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a> Introduction

   Being able to reference a requirement within a large document aids
   many stakeholders within projects.  Author and reviewer while the
   specification is being written and discussed.  The developer during
   implementation and testing.  Customer while accepting the final
   product.

   A test suite could e.g. use the wording of a requirement verbatim if
   it fails, by parsing the referenced requirement.  Having a way to
   easily index all requirements and reference them elsewhere keeps the
   requirements at it's source.

<a id="section-1.2" href="#section-1.2">1.2</a> Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>.

<a id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a> Requirement Identifier Syntax

   Requirement identifiers MUST<a id="1" href="#1" class="R">(R1)</a> be placed directly after keywords as
   defined by <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>.  Requirement identifiers SHOULD<a id="2" href="#2" class="R">(R2)</a> be written
   within parenthesis and start with 'R' followed by a number.  This
   combination is less likely to conflict with normal wording and use of
   parenthesis within a document.  Requirement identifiers MUST<a id="3" href="#3" class="R">(R3)</a> be
   unique within one specification.

   Example;

       "... MUST NOT(R1) .." ok
       "... SHOULD ..."      missing identifier
       "... MAY (R1) ..."    error spacing after keyword
       "... SHOULD\nNOT(R1)" ok when keyword split over two lines


   It is RECOMMENDED<a id="4" href="#4" class="R">(R4)</a> that authors do not use identifier series for
   grouping, e.g. identifiers within the R100 series are used for
   feature X and R200 series for feature Y.  It is also RECOMMENDED<a id="5" href="#5" class="R">(R5)</a>
   that authors not change identifiers for one requirement over time.
   This is however likely to happen more during authoring and reviewing
   phase but should be avoided once a specification is published.
